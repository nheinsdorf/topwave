# Topwave

Topwave is a Python library for the calculation of Tight Binding (TB) or Linear Spin Wave Theory (LSWT) spectra and their topological properties. 

The library is designed to be easy to read and use and should enable even new-comers to calculate topological properties of electron or magnon spectra with only a few lines of code. The package makes use of the extensive functionality of the Python Materials Genomics (Pymatgen) software package (https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen) helping the user to quickly set up both easy toy models and more realistic simulations for real materials respecting the symmetries of the provided space group.
