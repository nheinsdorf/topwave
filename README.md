</p>

The `topwave` library is an open-source software for simulations of single-particle models and the classification of their band topological phases.

The library is designed to be easy to use and read. It allows even new-comers to calculate topological properties 
of e.g. electron or magnon spectra with only a few lines of code. The package interfaces with the extensive 
Python Materials Genomic library helping the user to quickly set up both easy toy models and more realistic simulations 
for materials respecting the symmetries of the crystal structure.
