class WCC_evolution(object):
    """Class for the evolution of Wannier Charge Centers on some path.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : topwave.model.Model
        The model the evolution of which is to be calculated.
    loops : list
        A list of loops where each loop is a closed set of k-points.
    occ : list
        List of integers that specify all occupied bands.

    Attributes
    ----------
    MODEL : topwave.model.Model
        This is where model is stored.
    NLOOP : int
        Number of Wilson loops
    KS : list
        This is where loops is stored. It is a numloops-long list of
        numk-points x 3 numpy.ndarrays.
    OCC : list
        This is where occ is stored.
    NOCC : int
        This gives the number of occupied bands.
    N : int
        Number of magnetic sites in model.
    WCCs : numpy.ndarray
        This is where the Wannier Charge Centers are stored. Shape is
        NOCC x NLOOP. It's not converted into a numpy.ndarray in case the


    Methods
    -------
    generate_couplings(maxdist, sg=None):
        Given a maximal distance (in Angstrom) all periodic bonds are
        generated and grouped by symmetry based on the provided sg.
